    # To-Do List App (Python)

## Description:
This project is a simple to-do list application built using Python. The goal of this project was to practice my Python skills, work on organizing code into functions, and get hands-on experience with basic data structures and file handling.

## What I Learned:
- **Python Fundamentals**: Enhanced my understanding of Python syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries), and file handling (reading/writing data).
- **Software Development**: Improved my coding practices such as organizing code into functions and creating a simple, functional application.
- **Version Control**: Familiarized myself with Git and GitHub for version control, collaborating, and maintaining code across different environments.
- **Problem Solving**: Applied logic and problem-solving skills to implement features like adding, removing, and viewing tasks in the to-do list.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (for building the app)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **GitHub** (for hosting the repository and sharing my work)

## Future Enhancements:
- **AI Integration**: I plan to integrate an AI component to predict the priority of tasks based on user behaviour and past task history.
- **Web Interface**: Add a simple web interface using Flask or Django to make the to-do list accessible online.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning algorithms to suggest tasks or reminders based on user patterns.

## Relevance to My Career:
This project is part of my journey to become an AI Engineer. In the future, I will focus on AI/ML-based applications like intelligent task management systems, NLP for voice-based reminders, and integrating cloud services for scalability. Through building this project, Iâ€™ve strengthened my problem-solving skills and developed a deeper understanding of Python, version control, and software development practices, which are foundational for AI engineering.
