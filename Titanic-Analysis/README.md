Titanic Analysis Project

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore passenger survival rates using Python. It demonstrates fundamental skills in data analysis, visualization, and coding practices.

Skills Learned

    1. Data Handling with Pandas
        ◦ Loaded the Titanic dataset using pandas.
        ◦ Explored data structures and performed summary statistics with .head(), .info(), and .describe().
        ◦ Cleaned data by addressing missing values and formatting issues.
    2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
        ◦ Created various visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots to understand data trends.
        ◦ Used Seaborn for creating visually appealing and informative plots (e.g., survival rates by gender, class, age).
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        ◦ Conducted EDA to identify key patterns and insights, such as relationships between passenger class, age, and survival rates.
        ◦ Investigated correlations between features like age and survival probability.
    4. File Handling and Integration
        ◦ Saved and exported the notebook in multiple formats (e.g., .ipynb, .html) for easy sharing.
        ◦ Worked seamlessly between Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to transfer and analyze data.
    5. Problem-Solving and Analytical Thinking
        ◦ Solved real-world data issues such as missing or inconsistent values and choosing appropriate visualizations for analysis.
        ◦ Formulated analytical questions (e.g., What factors influence survival in the Titanic dataset?) and explored answers.

Project Highlights

    • Dataset Exploration:
        ◦ Viewed column names and data types to understand the dataset structure.
        ◦ Generated summary statistics to assess features and their relationships with survival.
    • Visualizations:
        ◦ Used Seaborn to create a bar plot showing survival counts across various categories (e.g., gender, passenger class).
        ◦ Visualized key patterns to identify trends and draw conclusions.

Tools Used

    • Google Colab: For writing and running Python code in a cloud-based environment with GPU/TPU acceleration.
    • pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (loading, cleaning, and exploring datasets).
    • matplotlib and seaborn: For creating various plots and visualizing data trends.
    • Jupyter Notebook: For running Python code locally and documenting analysis with Markdown.

Future Work

    • Machine Learning Integration:
        ◦ Plan to add a machine learning model to predict passenger survival based on features like age, class, and gender. For example, implementing logistic regression or decision trees to classify survivors.
    • Model Evaluation:
        ◦ Test and evaluate the performance of the machine learning model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
    • Data Enrichment:
        ◦ Explore additional datasets to enrich the analysis, such as adding passenger ticket details or geographical information about their embarkation point.
    • Web Interface:
        ◦ Add a simple web interface using Flask or Django to allow users to input their own data (e.g., passenger details) and predict their survival chance on the Titanic.
